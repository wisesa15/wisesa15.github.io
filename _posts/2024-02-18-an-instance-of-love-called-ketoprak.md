> Disclaimer: This post was written after some random thoughts on the way to buy ketoprak, with much help from ChatGPT. I just poured out all my thoughts to ChatGPT, and it rephrased them into better, more readable writing.

When we talk about love, it's often centered around our relationships with other people, be it family, friends, or someone special in our lives.

However... we're aware that people will eventually leave, and we find ourselves alone with our thoughts. What would you do if that happened? For me, without a doubt, I would buy ketoprak. I buy ketoprak for many reasons—whether it is because I am hungry, I feel sad, I feel stressed, or I just want to eat ketoprak. Occasionally, I'd ask the 'abang-abang' to give me two eggs, just because, why not?

Before talking too much about ketoprak, let's first talk about love—the romantic kind. The feelings that arise when someone, unrelated by family, randomly enters your life. It feels incredibly wonderful and simultaneously painful.

The greatness stems from experiencing things that wouldn't occur without love. Yet, the pain arises because, inevitably, that person will leave you at some point. Even someone you thought was 'the one' will leave. Perhaps not willingly, but inevitably, they will leave you—whether because of death, betrayal, lust, or simply because they want something they think is better. Sometimes, it's just because life is unpredictable, and things change in ways we can't control.

I haven't met that 'the one' person yet, but I did have a special relationship that I believed would always be significant. Just so you (yes, you, the one reading this seemingly trivial blog post) understand the background, I knew we—me and that person—would eventually separate romantically due to different religions. However, I never anticipated that we would cease being friends. Well, actually, I don't know what to call my relationship with her now. If I say we're not friends, that might be true since we don't talk much anymore, but if I say we're friends, it doesn't feel like we're close friends. So, maybe 'acquaintance' is a better word to describe our relationship now.

The day she suggested we return to being just friends didn’t feel as upsetting as I expected. Of course, I felt a little down, but I tried to see it as God's way of parting us amicably, allowing us to maintain a friendship where we could still talk and share stories. However, the day I found out she had moved on and had someone new in her life was not long after I realized I needed to move on, something I had avoided for a long time because I foolishly thought I didn’t have to. But when I started trying to forget her, little by little, that’s when I learned she had completely erased me from her life. I was shocked, and my heart shattered when I realized she now had someone she felt comfortable sharing her stories with—someone who had taken my place, or perhaps, someone who was always meant to be in that place since I had never really been there.

Suddenly, all forms of love—romantic and platonic—vanished. It might not have felt so abrupt if I had been more aware of her feelings when she was still close to me. I realize now that I wasn’t a good listener. Looking back, I see how I often seemed indifferent to her stories, too eager to share my own. Or sometimes, it was just the wrong time, and I tried to talk to her without really paying attention, ending up saying things that made it obvious I wasn’t fully present in the moment. I only realized this now because I discovered some old chat backups and, after decrypting the file as a fun weekend project (just because I enjoyed the challenge of cracking it), I ended up reading our chats with no real reason. But when I read my own messages, I suddenly hated myself. Hahaha. Well, at the end of the day, it's a nice thing to know and can help me learn from my past mistakes.

This blog post may seem scattered, like I don't know what to say. That's because I genuinely didn't. Like when she asked my opinion about us being just friends—I only said that I don't know because I really didn't know what to say. It felt like I wanted her to stay, but I didn't want to force her into something she didn't want anymore. This post started because I wanted to express my love for ketoprak, and then it made me think about the concept of love and why I don't enjoy watching romantic scenes in movies, whereas I used to really like romcoms before. I've realized that my views on loving a person have changed so much since then because, for now, I think people will always disappoint you, including and especially in matters of love. Finally, I just realized that I have many faults and don't really have a chance to say sorry. So, I just want to say I'm sorry for everything, in case you accidentally bump into this post. Have a great life.

To end this writing, I want to go back to ketoprak. I don't know what happened, but I really like ketoprak. I might have been under the spell of the 'abang-abang' ketoprak. But if you ended up feeling hungry from reading this, then BUY KETOPRAK!
