This post has three versions: the one I wrote alone with bad grammar, the one paraphrased by ChatGPT, and the combined version of the two to create a better story, at least for me.

If, for whatever reason, you want to read this blog post, just go for the combined version, so you won't waste too much of your time. I prefer it the most, and I also added something in there.

## My version

When we talk about love, so often we talk about our relationship with another people. Whether it is family, friends, or someone special in your life.

But... we all know that people will leaves you at some point and you will be alone with your thoughts. What would you do if that happened? For me, definitely, I will buy ketoprak. Sometimes, I will ask the seller to gives me two eggs. Just because, why not?

Before we talk much about ketoprak, let's talk about love first, the romantic one, the feelings that that happened when someone who aren't family, aren't related, are randomly shows up in your life. How it feels so great and worst at the same time.

It feels so great because you could feel many things that never happened without love. But, it feels worst because, at some point, that person will leaves you. Even someone that you thought are "the one" will leaves you. Maybe not because she/he wants to do that, but apparently she/he will leaves you, because of death or just because that is how life works.

I am not yet met that "the one" person. But I think, I ever have one special relationship that I thought will always be special. Just so you (yes, you. The one who read this stupid blog post) know the background, actually I know that we will get separated romantically at the end because of different religions. But I never thought that we will stopped being friend.

The day she said that she want us to be just friends didn't feel that bad. Ofc I feel blue, but, on the positive side, I think it is how God separate us. Amicably and keep being friends that could talks about things and share each other stories. But, the day when I know that she is moved on, that is when my heart really breaks. She never told me that there are other person who try to be close with her and she feel comfortable with him. That day I realise that she never told her stories anymore to me. She isn't just moved on. She erase me completely from her life. She didn't need me anymore.

Suddenly all the loves, romantically, and platonically are disappear. Well, maybe it won't feel so sudden if I hear her feelings when she is still close to me. Yeah, I know that it is my fault that sometimes I looks like I don't really care about her stories just because I feel so light up to tell my story to her.

Maybe this blog post feel so jumpy. It looks like I don't know what to tell. Well, that happened because I really don't know what to tell. First, I want to talk about how ketoprak is something that I love so much and how I don't really care about loving a person anymore because people will dissapoint you and leave. Then, I just want to tell about my first, last, and only break up and how it affects my views towards love. Finally, I realise that it is actually my fault that she left. So, I just want to say that I am sorry for everything. Have a great life.

## ChatGPT version

When we discuss love, it's often centered around our relationships with other people, be it family, friends, or someone special in our lives.

However, we're aware that people will eventually leave, and we find ourselves alone with our thoughts. What would you do if that happened? For me, without a doubt, I would buy ketoprak. Occasionally, I'd ask the seller to give me two eggs, just because, why not?

Before delving into ketoprak, let's first talk about love—the romantic kind. The feelings that arise when someone, unrelated by family, randomly enters your life. It feels incredibly wonderful and simultaneously painful.

The greatness stems from experiencing things that wouldn't occur without love. Yet, the pain arises because, inevitably, that person will leave. Even someone you thought was "the one" will depart. Perhaps not willingly, but life dictates it, whether through death or the natural course of existence.

I haven't met that "the one" person yet, but I did have a special relationship that I believed would always be significant. Just so you (yes, you, the one reading this seemingly trivial blog post) understand the background, I knew we would eventually separate romantically due to different religions. However, I never anticipated that we would cease being friends.

The day she suggested we remain just friends didn't feel terribly upsetting. Of course, I felt a bit down, but on the positive side, I viewed it as God's way of parting us amicably while maintaining a friendship where we could talk and share stories. However, the day I learned she had moved on was when my heart truly shattered. She never mentioned another person getting close to her, someone she felt comfortable with. That day, I realized she no longer shared her stories with me. She hadn't just moved on; she had completely erased me from her life. She no longer needed me.

Suddenly, all forms of love—romantic and platonic—vanished. Perhaps it wouldn't have felt so abrupt if I had been more attentive to her feelings when she was still close to me. I acknowledge it's my fault; sometimes, I seemed indifferent to her stories because I was too eager to share my own.

This blog post may seem scattered, like I don't know what to say. That's because I genuinely didn't. Initially, I wanted to express my love for ketoprak and my indifference toward loving a person because people will disappoint and leave. Then, I wanted to recount my first, last, and only breakup and its impact on my perspective of love. Finally, I realized it was my fault she left. So, I just want to say I'm sorry for everything. Have a great life.

The day she suggested we are back to be just friends didn't feel terribly upsetting. Of course, I felt a bit down, but on the positive side, I viewed it as God's way of parting us amicably while maintaining a friendship where we could talk and share stories. However, the day I learned she had moved on was when my heart truly shattered. She never mentioned another person getting close to her, someone she felt comfortable with.

Yeah, I know that it is my fault; sometimes, I seemed indifferent to her stories because I was too eager to share my own. Or sometimes, it just the time that isn't good so I try to talk with her without really paying attention and ended up say something that looks like I don't pay attention.

This blog post may seem scattered, like I don't know what to say. That's because I genuinely didn't. Like when she ask my opinion about us to be just friends—I only said that I don't know because I don't want to force her into a relationship, but I do want to. Initially, I wanted to express my love for ketoprak and my indifference toward loving a person because people will disappoint and leave. Then, I wanted to recount my first, last, and only breakup and its impact on my perspective of love. Finally, I realized it was my fault she left. So, I just want to say I'm sorry for everything. Have a great life.
