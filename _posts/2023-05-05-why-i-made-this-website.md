Recently, I had a discussion with my friend about the need for a portfolio website. I didn't really feel the need for one, but I remembered that GitHub can host a static site. So, I suggested my friend to use GitHub and forgot about our conversation afterwards. The idea of using GitHub was a little overwhelming because we needed to design the website, which could be tedious. However, a few days later, I saw Andrej Karpathy share his old blog post, which inspired me to write a blog again. I did some research on how to use GitHub Pages as a blog and found that it was pretty easy using Jekyll. Actually, being a blogger was my dream when I was in elementary school because, at that time, there were many bloggers in Indonesia that got a lot of attention. But that was only in the past. For now, the idea of blogging seems intriguing because I can share and document my learning journey. On the other hand, I don't feel good about sharing my thoughts on Twitter because it feels unserious. It's better to use it just for laugh. So, I think writing a blog post will be nice if I want to write about more serious matters
